Install Node.js on your VPS/Computer. If you are running Ubuntu, which I reccomend, use this guide to install node. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04

If you are using a windows VPS, just go to their site and download version 3.6.0

Make a fake discord account & join the servers used for fetching ( Trivia Addicts, trivia Tribe) you can add more servers if you like by grabbing the channel ID of the sepcific game being played and putting it in the code

Grab the token of the user ( see https://github.com/TheRacingLion/Discord-SelfBot/wiki/Discord-Token-Tutorial for more details)

Input the token into the bot code and make a bot user at https://discordapp.com/developers

Put the bot token into the code

Put the output channel Id into the code ( where you would like the answers to be sent to)

Install discord.js & other modules needed and then run forever start trivia.js

If you are having errors such as {module discord.js could not be found}, do this. npm i (the module that can not be found here)

Once the bot is online, when a question pops up on screen immediatly run the /hq, /cs or /jr command. (dependent on wheter you are playing HQ, Cash show, Or Joyride at that time) Note: Please read the TOS before proceeding with the use of this bot
